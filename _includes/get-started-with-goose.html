<h2>Get Started with GoOSe</h2>

<p>The GoOSe Project is a meritocracy. Those that do the work and get involved decide its direction and focus.</p>

<p>As with any open source project, GoOSe needs contributors. There is always work to be done. If you have interest in helping the GoOSe Project, there are just a few steps you need to take to get involved.</p>

<p>Getting involved in GoOSe is definitely something one should take time to consider. Once involved, it may lead to long hours in front of a computer, talking with cool people and working on cool projects. Don't let that dissuade you, there will also be releases and future events where all members of the GoOSe project will gather and enjoy a weekend of hacking and drinking.</p>
