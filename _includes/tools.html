<p>In the process of cooking this GoOSe, we have created some interesting tools to make our lives easier.<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/skein">Skein</a> -- Skein is the tool which gooseproject uses to gather and import srpms.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/grapple">Grapple</a> -- Grapple is a tool to respond to Github post-receive hooks
and then kick off a package build in Koji.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gooseproject/Chase">Chase</a> -- Chase is the GoOSe Project reporting tool. It provides basic information from koji, github and other tools we use.</li>
</ul>
