This is a test post with stuff and things. That means that three hundred and sixty six days ago, almost to the minute, I was sitting alone in a booth at Zeke's Sports Bar and Grill on 3rd Street in San Francisco. I wouldn't normally hang out at a sports bar, let alone a sports bar in SOMA, but back then Thursday was "I Can Has Ruby" night. I guess back then "I can has _______" was also a reasonable moniker to attach to pretty much anything. ICHR was a semi-private meeting of like minded Ruby Hackers that generally and willingly devolved into late night drinking sessions. Normally these nights would fade away like my hangover the next morning, but this night was different. This was the night that "GitHub":http://github.com/ was born.

The next night, Friday, October 19, 2007 at 10:24pm Chris made the first commit to the GitHub repository and sealed in digital stone the beginning of our joint venture. There were, so far, no agreements of any kind regarding how things would proceed. Just two guys that decided to hack together on something that sounded cool.

Remember those amazing few minutes in Karate Kid where Daniel is training to become a martial arts expert?
