GoOSE Sprint 2011-10-22

Today is one of those nice Saturdays in Draper, UT.

A great day to get out and enjoy a lunch and coffee
with good friends while hacking away at projects.

Of course if you can't be here in Draper then you might
be somelplace like Atlanta or Virginia and joining in on
the fun from home.

The Fun?

Today is the first, but not the last of the GoOSe sprint days.
A day to focus on and work on the the GoOSe Project.

Things that have received attention are:

<ul>
<li>The GoOSe webiste</li>
<li>Skein</li>
<li>Misc.</li>
</ul>

Join us for the next of the GoOSe sprint and maybe the 
upcoming GoOSe con?
