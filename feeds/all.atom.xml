Those that do the work and get involved decide its direction and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any open source project, GoOSe needs contributors. There is always work to be done. If you have interest in helping the GoOSe Project, there are just a few steps you need to take to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="signup.html"&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take on a Task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a Role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy the Benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting involved in GoOSe is definitely something one should take time to consider. Once involved, it may lead to long hours in front of a computer, talking with cool people and working on cool projects. Don't let that dissuade you, there will also be releases and future events where all members of the GoOSe project will gather and enjoy a weekend of hacking and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

Each of them contribute something to the Enterprise Linux community in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the GoOSe Project we believe in building a community around the process of building Enterprise Linux from scratch. Our end goal is to provide a system that is not only reproducible by others, but also built by the many hands of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been and will continue to be many challenges to overcome and problems to solve that will be very interesting. Won't you help us? Getting started doesn't require years of training or secret pass phrases. Join our IRC channel (#gooseproject on irc.freenode.net) and the mailing list (&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:goose-linux&amp;#64;googlegroups.com"&gt;goose-linux&amp;#64;googlegroups.com&lt;/a&gt;) to discuss what GoOSe is and what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there has been a question about a similar project, AscendOS, and GoOSe. While both projects believe that it is important to create communities to build an Enterprise Linux system, at this time both projects are separate, but communicative of issues and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe that an excellent enterprise operating system is built by an excellent community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community at GoOSe is what comes first. We believe a strong community provides the best opportunity for continued success. While it might be more work up front to get people going, culture and knowledge sharing are what makes GoOSe Linux unique. Following 'The Open Source Way', we document as we go to help others grow and learn with us. GoOSe is about community, sharing, technology and passion. Join the next phase in enterprise open source, GoOSe Linux!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting involved in GoOSe is definitely something one should take time to consider. Once involved, it may lead to long hours in front of a computer, talking with cool people and working on cool projects. Don't let that dissuade you, there will also be releases and future events where all members of the GoOSe project will gather and enjoy a weekend of hacking and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
