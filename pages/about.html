    		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The GoOSe Project creates a Linux distribution of a Prominent North American Enterprise Linux Vendor. They object to being referred to by name in the context of clones and ports of their distribution. GoOSe Linux is similar to CentOS and Scientific Linux in form, thus should make it clear upon what Upstream version it is based.</p>
<p>GoOSe Linux, the resulting distribution, is the result of the hard work of many individuals worldwide who have given their time and talent to open source. The GoOSe Project aims to provide the best of breed Enterprise Linux Rebuild along with the best documentation and community support. We believe that a good Linux distributistarts first with an excellent community.</p>
<div class="section" id="ethos">
<h2>Ethos</h2>
<p>At the GoOSe Project we believe in building a community around the process of building Enterprise Linux from scratch. Our end goal is to provide a system that is not only reproducible by others, but also built by the many hands of friends. Read more about our ethos <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gooseproject/main/wiki/gooseproject_ethos">here</a></p>
<p>The GoOSe Project is different from CentOS and Scientific Linux in a few ways, though some of the results are the same. The GoOSe project focuses on the following aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Building a sustainable and lasting community of users <strong>*and*</strong> contributors</li>
<li>A documentation project which is targeted at explaining the entire process of rebuilding Enterprise Linux</li>
<li>As a result of the goals above, The GoOSe Projects produces a free and open source Enterprise Linux Rebuild (EL Rebuild), appropriately named 'GoOSe Linux'</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently there has been a question about a similar project, AscendOS, and GoOSe. While both projects believe that it is important to create communities to build an Enterprise Linux system, at this time both projects are separate, but communicative of issues and goals.</p>

<div class="section" id="join-the-goose-project">
<h2>Join The GoOSe Project</h2>
<p>There have been and will continue to be many challenges to overcome and problems to solve that will be very interesting. Won't you help us? Getting started doesn't require years of training or secret pass phrases. Join our IRC channel (#gooseproject on irc.freenode.net) and the mailing list (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:goose-linux&#64;googlegroups.com">goose-linux&#64;googlegroups.com</a>) to discuss what GoOSe is and what we do.</p>
<p>The GoOSe Project is a meritocracy. Those that do the work and get involved decide its direction and focus.</p>
<p>As with any open source project, GoOSe needs contributors. There is always work to be done. If you have interest in helping the GoOSe Project, check out our <a class="reference external" href="community.html">Community</a> page. It reveals all the dirt on how GoOSe works, how to join The GoOSe Project and how to make your first contribution (hint: it's dead simple to get started).</p>

<div class="section" id="download-the-latest-build">
<h2>Download the Latest Build</h2>
<p>The latest (and first) release of GoOSe Linux is currently 6.0 and in the Final testing phase. It can be downloaded at <a class="reference external" href="http://get.gooseproject.org/">http://get.gooseproject.org</a>. A mirror list is in the works as well, so watch for that in the near future. Additional download options can be found at our <a class="reference external" href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="read-the-documentation">
<h2>Read the Documentation</h2>
<p>Currently available is the draft documentation entitled, 'How to Cook a GoOSe'. This document will eventually cover the front-to-back of how to rebuild Enterprise Linux. Additional documentation is available on the GoOSe Project wiki at github. Here are a few highlights and ideas.</p>
