About the "Simple Project"
--------------------------

The "Simple Project" is nothing more (or less) than a YAML based layout template 
in a recommended and "ready to use" project structure.

It's a sample project that allows the user to start testing or developing with YAML immediately 
and/or working with the YAML Builder (http://builder.yaml.de).
