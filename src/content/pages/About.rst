There are many different projects that rebuild Enterprise Linux from scratch. Each of them contribute something to the Enterprise Linux community in their own way.

At the GoOSe Project we believe in building a community around the process of building Enterprise Linux from scratch. Our end goal is to provide a system that is not only reproducible by others, but also built by the many hands of friends.

There have been and will continue to be many challenges to overcome and problems to solve that will be very interesting. Won't you help us? Getting started doesn't require years of training or secret pass phrases. Join our IRC channel (#gooseproject on irc.freenode.net) and the mailing list (goose-linux@googlegroups.com) to discuss what GoOSe is and what we do.

Recently there has been a question about a similar project, AscendOS, and GoOSe. While both projects believe that it is important to create communities to build an Enterprise Linux system, at this time both projects are separate, but communicative of issues and goals.
