The GoOSe Project is all about the community. We believe that an excellent enterprise operating system is built by an excellent community.

The community at GoOSe is what comes first. We believe a strong community provides the best opportunity for continued success. While it might be more work up front to get people going, culture and knowledge sharing are what makes GoOSe Linux unique. Following 'The Open Source Way', we document as we go to help others grow and learn with us. GoOSe is about community, sharing, technology and passion. Join the next phase in enterprise open source, GoOSe Linux!

Getting involved in GoOSe is definitely something one should take time to consider. Once involved, it may lead to long hours in front of a computer, talking with cool people and working on cool projects. Don't let that dissuade you, there will also be releases and future events where all members of the GoOSe project will gather and enjoy a weekend of hacking and drinking.

Join The GoOSe Project
----------------------

There have been and will continue to be many challenges to overcome and problems to solve that will be very interesting. Won't you help us? Getting started doesn't require years of training or secret pass phrases. Join our IRC channel (#gooseproject on irc.freenode.net) and the mailing list (goose-linux@googlegroups.com) to discuss what GoOSe is and what we do.

The GoOSe Project is a meritocracy. Those that do the work and get involved decide its direction and focus.

As with any open source project, GoOSe needs contributors. There is always work to be done. If you have interest in helping the GoOSe Project, check out our `README <https://github.com/gooseproject/main/blob/master/README.rst>`_. It reveals all the dirt on how to join The GoOSe Project and how to make your first contribution (hint: it's dead simple to get started).
