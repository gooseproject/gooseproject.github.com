GoOSe Project Website Style Guide

* Licensing

The GoOSe proeject uses a layout based on YAML (http://www.yaml.de).
YAML is published under the Common Creatives Attributions 2.2 license and requires
a back link to the original project page in a prominant location or in the
imprent of the site.

To stay compliant we should ensure that a compliant footer is included in the layout
of every page.
