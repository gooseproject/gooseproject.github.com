License conditions
==================

Current and future releases
---------------------------
YAML has been licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 License (CC-A 2.0) since version 2.2. For commercial
use, two alternative license models are available (see below).

Older releases
--------------
Older releases before version 2.2 were published exclusively under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 License (CC-A 2.0).


General Information
-------------------
The Creative Commons license permits both the non-commercial and the commercial use of the framework on the condition
that a backlink to the project homepage remains in the layout (see the next section).

Freelancers and web agencies, however, cannot always conform to the terms of use of the Creative Commons license, as
customers seldom desire copyright notices of third party projects on their sites. In order to make the use of YAML possible
in these cases, two license models for commercial use have been developed, alternative to the Creative Commons license.
Both models are set up as single payments and include the use of any future releases.


YAML under Creative Commons License (CC-A 2.0)
==============================================

The YAML framework is published under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 License, which permits both private and
commercial use. For the free use of the YAML framework, a backlink to the YAML homepage (http://www.yaml.de) in a
suitable place (e.g.: footer of the website or in the imprint) is required.

A small thank you
-----------------
In general it would be nice to get a short note when new YAML-based projects are released. 
If you are highly pleased with YAML and the forum support, perhaps you would like to take a look at my Amazon wish list?

YAML under Commercial License (YAML-C)
======================================

Two alternative license models are available for using the framework without the otherwise required backlink.
Commercial licenses can be orderd at https://shop.yaml.de/.
